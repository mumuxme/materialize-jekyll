#### Introduction

Hephy Workflow v2.19.0 (codename: Tag-Team) is published! Hephy Workflow is the
open source fork of Deis Workflow which was EOL by Deis Team on 03/01/2018.
The Deis Team moved on to work on Helm and Azure at Microsoft and this open
source project was forked by Team Hephy as Hephy Workflow.

#### Current Patch Level - v2.19.4 (latest)

The [v2.19.4][] patch is another chart-only update of Workflow that fixes an
incompatible K8s version issue with the way that GKE reports its version in the
Kubernetes controller API.  This release is tested and known to work with K8s
clusters on <b>Amazon Web Services</b>, <b>Google Kubernetes Engine</b>, <b>Azure Kubernetes Service</b>, and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube">Minikube</a> too.
