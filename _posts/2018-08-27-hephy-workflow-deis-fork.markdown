This is Kingdon and we're happy to answer questions of any kind about the fork!

For anyone who has not heard of Deis Workflow, it is a Kubernetes project from the same team that brought you Helm. The workflow that it enables is "git push" to deploy. Dockerfile and Docker "pull-style" image deploys are also possible.

The Deis project itself is very well documented, but Team Hephy is still nascent. We are in the process of building our own documentation. The fork is currently very close to the original, so all of the prior documentation [is still fine](https://teamhephy.info/docs/workflow/).

We have mostly added support for newer Kubernetes API versions in this release, as well as some updates to the platform router.

[//]: # def print_hi(name)
[//]: #   puts "Hi, #{name}"
[//]: # end
[//]: # print_hi('Tom')
